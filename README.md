# draggable-each

@stefanpenner's https://github.com/stefanpenner/d-d repackaged as an ember-cli-addon, which wraps jquery-ui-sortable in an ember component.

## Using this component in your ember-cli app

Add a dependency to your `package.json` file like:

  `"draggable-each": "krisselden/draggable-each"`

or

  `"draggable-each": "https://github.com/krisselden/draggable-each/archive/v0.0.x.tar.gz"`

Then run `npm install` and use the `draggable-each` as you see fit. See `test/dummy/app` for examples of usage.

This rest of this README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember addon.

## Installation

* `git clone` this repository
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

## Running the sample app

* `ember server`
* Visit your app at http://localhost:4200.

Note: development requires ember-cli > 0.4.0. At the time of this writing, that means master.

## Running Tests

* `ember test --server`

## Building

* `ember build`
